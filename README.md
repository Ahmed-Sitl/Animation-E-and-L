# Animation Grid README

This project demonstrates an animation effect using HTML and CSS to create a grid with moving elements. The code showcases the animation of two orange squares moving within the grid container.

## Code Explanation

### HTML Structure

- `index.html`: This file contains the basic HTML structure. It includes a container div with two child elements, each further divided into several nested divs.

### CSS Styles

- `styles.css`: This stylesheet contains the styling and animations for the HTML elements.

#### Global Styles

- `* { box-sizing: border-box; }`: Sets the `box-sizing` property for all elements to include padding and border in the element's total width and height calculation.

#### Container Styles

- `.parent`: Styles the main container div. It sets a fixed width and height, creates a grid layout with two columns of 240px each, and adds a 15px gap between columns. The container has a relative position.

#### Child Element Styles

- `.E div, .L div`: Styles all divs within elements with classes `.E` and `.L` with a background color.

#### Grid Layouts

- `.E, .L`: Defines grid layouts for the children elements.

#### Grid Item Placement

- `.one`, `.two`, `.three`, `.four`, `.five`, `.first`, `.second`: Specifies the positions of specific divs within the grid layout using the `grid-area` property.

#### Animation Styles

- `.parent::before` and `.parent::after`: Create two orange squares as pseudo-elements. They are positioned absolutely within the `.parent` container and have animations applied.

#### Keyframe Animations

- `@keyframes move-e`: Defines the animation for the first orange square (`::before`). It animates the square to move in a specific path within the `.parent` container.

- `@keyframes move-l`: Defines the animation for the second orange square (`::after`). It animates the square to appear, move, and then disappear within the `.parent` container.
